<h1>libffi - a portable foreign function interface library</h1>

<b>libffi-3.0.4</b> was released on February 24, 2008. You can ftp it
from <a
href="ftp://sourceware.org:/pub/libffi/libffi-3.0.4.tar.gz">sourceware.org:/pub/libffi/libffi-3.0.4.tar.gz</a>.

<p>

libffi is free software.  It has a very <a
href="http://sources.redhat.com/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/~checkout~/libffi/LICENSE?rev=1.6&content-type=text/plain&cvsroot=libffi&only_with_tag=MAIN">liberal
license</a>.

<h2>What is libffi?</h2>

Compilers for high level languages generate code that follows certain
conventions. These conventions are necessary, in part, for separate
compilation to work. One such convention is the "calling
convention". The "calling convention" is a set of assumptions made by
the compiler about where function arguments will be found on entry to
a function. A "calling convention" also specifies where the return
value for a function is found.

<p>

Some programs may not know at the time of compilation what arguments
are to be passed to a function. For instance, an interpreter may be
told at run-time about the number and types of arguments used to call
a given function. Libffi can be used in such programs to provide a
bridge from the interpreter program to compiled code.

<p>

The libffi library provides a portable, high level programming
interface to various calling conventions. This allows a programmer to
call any function specified by a call interface description at
run-time.

<p>

FFI stands for Foreign Function Interface. A foreign function
interface is the popular name for the interface that allows code
written in one language to call code written in another language. The
libffi library really only provides the lowest, machine dependent
layer of a fully featured foreign function interface. A layer must
exist above libffi that handles type conversions for values passed
between the two languages.

<h2>How to get it</h2>

You can download the latest version from <a href="ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/libffi/">sources.redhat.com:/pub/libffi/</a>.  

<p>

You can also check out the very latest version via anonymous cvs.
Here's how:
<pre>
 cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@sources.redhat.com:/cvs/libffi login
     (password is ``anoncvs'')
 cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@sources.redhat.com:/cvs/libffi co libffi
</pre>

Once you have it checked out, you can update it with <tt>cvs update</tt>.

<p>

You can also <a
href="http://sources.redhat.com/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/libffi/?cvsroot=libffi">
view the cvs archive</a> via cvsweb.

<h2>Mailing lists</h2>

For such a small piece of software, there are plenty of mailing lists
available.

<ul>
<li><a href="/ml/libffi-announce/"><tt>libffi-announce</tt></a> is a 
    low volume mailing list for libffi release announcements
<li><a href="/ml/libffi-discuss/"><tt>libffi-discuss</tt></a> is a 
    mailing list for asking questions, reporting bugs, etc.
