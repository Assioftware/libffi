# This file describes wrappers and other binary files to CVS.
#
# Wrappers are the concept where directories of files are to be
# treated as a single file.  The intended use is to wrap up a wrapper
# into a single tar such that the tar archive can be treated as a
# single binary file in CVS.
#
# To solve the problem effectively, it was also necessary to be able to
# prevent rcsmerge from merging these files.
#
# Format of wrapper file ($CVSROOT/CVSROOT/cvswrappers or .cvswrappers)
#
#  wildcard	[option value][option value]...
#
#  where option is one of
#  -f		from cvs filter		value: path to filter
#  -t		to cvs filter		value: path to filter
#  -m		update methodology	value: MERGE or COPY
#
#  and value is a single-quote delimited value.
#
# For example:

# Automatically handle files that show up on web pages but are binary.
